# CivicPlan Audit-Full Recovery Packet

Date: 2026-05-07
Repo: `CivicSuite/civicplan`
Branch: `recovery/civicplan-release-truth-gates`
Mode: release-gate recovery cleanup

## 1. Executive Audit

Scope: CivicPlan local checkout and live `origin/main` parity at branch
baseline. Local `HEAD` and `origin/main` matched at
`c801d73e74d6e6c737f689e5a8eca0a5aafb5c86`; the remote URL is
`https://github.com/CivicSuite/civicplan.git` with no embedded token.

Overall verdict: CivicPlan had useful implementation depth, but public docs
promoted the v1 label too strongly for the recovery standard. This branch
freezes fresh product-ready promotion, fixes WSL interpreter order, fixes fresh
install metadata by using the CivicCore release wheel, adds docs-source
guardrails, and will attach WSL/browser evidence before push.

Ship posture: do not promote CivicPlan as recertified product-ready until this
branch merges and post-merge CI is green.

Severity summary: Critical 2 fixed; Major 2 fixed; unresolved Blocker/Critical
0 in this branch-level recovery scope after verification.

Static audit confidence: high for release-script, dependency, and docs changes.
Runtime sign-off confidence: medium-high after WSL install, WSL release gate,
and Playwright docs QA; final confidence depends on post-merge CI.

CI/workflow posture: CI exists and runs release verification; final status must
be checked after PR push and merge.

## 3. Claim Verification Matrix

| Claim | Source | Verdict | Evidence |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CivicPlan v1 is a published label. | `pyproject.toml`, docs | True | Version remains `1.0.0`. |
| CivicPlan is freshly product-ready. | Prior README/manual wording | False as a current claim | Docs now mark v1 provisional during recovery. |
| Fresh install can resolve CivicCore. | `pyproject.toml` | True in branch | WSL fresh install succeeded with the published CivicCore wheel and Hatch direct references enabled. |
| WSL release verification proves Linux. | Prior script order | True in branch | WSL selected `.venv-wsl/bin/python3`, platform `linux`, and passed release gate. |

## 4. What The Dev Team Needs To Do Now

### Must fix before ship

- None remaining before PR push; post-merge CI still gates final recovery status.

### Should fix this sprint

- `CI-001`: Push PR, wait for CI, merge only if green.

### Can defer if consciously accepted

- `UX-002`: Full application Playwright recertification across all public and
  staff states before any public product-ready announcement.

## 5. Next-Sprint Watchlist

Architecture: preserve CivicPlan as a CivicCore consumer and context provider to
other modules without reverse dependency.
Security and compliance debt: expand staff-only planning analysis browser checks.
UX debt: convert historical screenshot evidence to executable user-flow tests.
Docs debt: keep recovery labels synchronized across README/manual/docs.
Install/bootstrap debt: add fresh WSL first-boot app walkthrough.
Test debt: add regression tests for every release-gate failure class.
Operational and release debt: require post-merge CI proof before status changes.

## 6. Engineering Deep Dive

Verdict: release-script interpreter order and package dependency metadata were
the primary engineering defects. Strengths: release script centralizes version,
tests, docs, ruff, and build. Verification gaps: post-merge CI.

### `[CRITICAL] REL-001 WSL release gate could select Windows Python`

- `Confidence`: High
- `Evidence type`: Runtime
- `Status`: Durable defect fixed

Why it matters:

A WSL release gate that runs Windows Python is not Linux evidence.

Evidence:

- `scripts/verify-release.sh` previously probed `python` before `python3`.
- The branch reverses that order and adds a regression test.

Blast radius:

- Every release verification run relying on WSL as Linux coverage.

Fix:

- Prefer native `python3` before `python`.

### `[CRITICAL] BOOT-001 Fresh installs could not resolve CivicCore`

- `Confidence`: High
- `Evidence type`: Runtime
- `Status`: Durable defect fixed

Why it matters:

`civiccore==1.0.0` is not a PyPI dependency path, so fresh installs can fail.

Evidence:

- `pyproject.toml` now points at the published CivicCore v1.0.0 release wheel
  and enables Hatch direct references.
- Fresh WSL install now succeeds.

Blast radius:

- New developer install, CI reproducibility, and release-package metadata.

Fix:

- Use the release-wheel direct URL and set
  `tool.hatch.metadata.allow-direct-references = true`.

## 7. Security And Authorization Deep Dive

Verdict: tracked-file secret scan returned no matches. Strengths: no live
vendor calls by default. Verification gaps: full browser role pass remains for
recertification.

## 8. UI/UX Deep Dive

Verdict: docs copy now sets accurate expectations and browser verification
passed. Strengths: docs landing page plainly says no legal advice or official
planning determinations and links to recovery status.

## 9. Product/PM Deep Dive

Verdict: product posture is now more honest: v1 exists as a label, not a fresh
announcement-ready certification. Verification gaps: broader suite retest.

## 10. Documentation Deep Dive

Verdict: stale product-release wording was real and fixed in branch. Strengths:
README, text README, manuals, changelog, and docs landing page now use recovery
language.

### `[MAJOR] DOC-001 Public docs overclaimed v1 status`

- `Confidence`: High
- `Evidence type`: Static
- `Status`: Durable defect fixed

Why it matters:

Municipal users and auditors read release language as a trust claim.

Evidence:

- Current-facing docs now say the v1 label is under release-recovery review.

Blast radius:

- README, manuals, changelog, and docs landing page.

Fix:

- Replace product-release wording and add docs gate banlist entries.

## 11. Install / Bootstrap / Seeding Deep Dive

Verdict: fresh WSL install and native WSL release gate both pass after the
dependency metadata fix. Verification gaps: post-merge CI.

## 12. Version And Release Consistency Deep Dive

Verdict: version remains `1.0.0`; release posture is provisional. No version
bump was made because this is recovery truth labeling, not a new product claim.

## 13. Test Engineering Deep Dive

Verdict: regression tests now cover the failure classes.

### `[MAJOR] TEST-001 Docs and release gates lacked regression coverage for recovery truth`

- `Confidence`: High
- `Evidence type`: Static
- `Status`: Durable defect fixed

Why it matters:

Without tests, the same overclaim, install defect, and WSL false-proof can
return.

Evidence:

- `tests/test_runtime_foundation.py` now checks dependency URL, Hatch direct
  references, interpreter order, docs banlist, and current docs recovery
  language.

Blast radius:

- Future release maintenance.

Fix:

- Add regression tests.

## 14. Runtime QA Deep Dive

Verdict: `[AUDITOR-RUN]` WSL and Playwright evidence passed. Prior historical
QA remains treated as historical evidence only.

## 15. Cross-Cutting Synthesis

The root issue is the same suite-wide pattern: release labels outpaced current
proof. This branch narrows the claim, locks a gate around the exact wording,
fixes package dependency truth, and fixes platform proof.

## 16. Verification Gaps And Sign-Off Limits

- Post-merge CI: required after PR merge.
- Full product recertification: outside this branch; required before public
  product-ready announcement.
